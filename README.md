# 911 Calls Capstone Project

For this capstone project, we will be analyzing 911 call data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes information such as latitude, longitude, description of the emergency call, zipcode, title of the call, timestamp, township, address, and a dummy variable 'e'.

## Data Description

The dataset contains various fields related to 911 emergency calls, providing valuable information for analysis. By exploring this dataset, we aim to gain insights into the nature of emergency calls, the most common reasons for calls, geographical distribution, and temporal patterns.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze the top 5 zipcodes and townships with the highest number of 911 calls.
- Identify unique title codes present in the dataset and explore the distribution of call reasons.
- Create new features based on call titles, such as categorizing calls into "Reasons/Departments" like EMS, Fire, and Traffic.
- Investigate temporal trends by analyzing timestamps, including hour, month, and day of the week of calls.
- Visualize the data using seaborn and matplotlib to better understand patterns and relationships within the dataset.

## Insights and Visualization

- Utilize visualization techniques to present findings, such as countplots, heatmaps, and clustermaps.
- Explore correlations between different variables and identify any trends or anomalies in the data.
- Provide detailed explanations of the analysis process and interpret visualizations to draw meaningful conclusions.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to extract meaningful insights from the 911 call data, understand the patterns and trends in emergency calls, and present the findings in a clear and informative manner. By utilizing data science techniques and visualization tools, we seek to enhance our understanding of emergency call data and contribute to the field of data analysis.

Feel free to explore the provided dataset further and expand on the analysis to uncover more insights and trends related to 911 emergency calls.
